<p>This paper looks at Brazil's unfinished trade reforms and argues that if the country really wants to fully enjoy the growth and welfare benefits of trade, it needs to further lower and rationalize its structure of protection, adopt a more aggressive, WTO-plus, policy to open markets abroad, design a regional integration strategy that makes sense to its smaller partners and bring trade facilitation, particularly, transport costs, to the core of its trade agenda. </p>

<p>
Established in 1959, we are the leading source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean, with a strong commitment to achieve measurable results, increased integrity, transparency and accountability. We have an evolving reform agenda that seeks to increase our development impact in the region.</p>
<p>
While we are a regular bank in many ways, we are also unique in some key respects. Besides loans, we also provide grants, technical assistance and do research. Our shareholders are 48 member countries, including 26 Latin American and Caribbean borrowing members, who have a majority ownership of the IDB.</p>
<p>
Our Fund for Special Operations (FSO) provides concessional financing to our most vulnerable member countries.</p>

<p>This paper looks at Brazil's unfinished trade reforms and argues that if the country really wants to fully enjoy the growth and welfare benefits of trade, it needs to further lower and rationalize its structure of protection, adopt a more aggressive, WTO-plus, policy to open markets abroad, design a regional integration strategy that makes sense to its smaller partners and bring trade facilitation, particularly, transport costs, to the core of its trade agenda. </p>
